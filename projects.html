        <h1 id="open-source">Open Source Projects</h1>
        <p>Below are various Ruby gems, plugins, and other open source projects I have contributed to. This list is by no means all-inclusive.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Rails</h4>
            <p>An extremely popular framework most often used with Ruby. I added documentation to the README about an important distinction between class methods and scopes with regard to querying the database.</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/23606">Pull Request & My Commits</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Time Log Robot</h4>
            <p>A command line tool I built that allows time logs to be simply and easily copied from Toggl into JIRA. It was battle-tested at my company by my tech team for ~1 year before we stopped tracking time and stopped using JIRA.</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/supremebeing7/time_log_robot">View Source</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Sorcery</h4>
            <p>A Ruby authentication gem similar to Devise, but much more lightweight. I contributed the Login with Salesforce option using Oauth2. </p>
            <a href="https://github.com/NoamB/sorcery/pull/652">Pull Request & My Commits</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Poper</h4>
            <p>A tool to automate ensuring git commit messages are well-formed. I added a way to configure rules surrounding message length and content (before, there was no way to specify so the tool was unusable if you didn't agree with the default rules).</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/mmozuras/poper/pull/6">Pull Request & My Commits</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Faker</h4>
            <p>A library for generating fake data, useful in testing. I converted arguments to use Ruby's keyword argument syntax so that it is clearer which args are doing what, and so that arguments are not positional.</p>
            <p><em>As of this writing, the code has not been merged because it contains breaking changes.</em><p>
            <a href="https://github.com/stympy/faker/pull/605">Pull Request & My Commits</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Atom Material UI Theme</h4>
            <p>A theme for the Atom text editor. I added toggle to allow removing the min-width option on tabs so horizontal scrolling in the tab bar is no longer necessary.</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/atom-material/atom-material-ui/pull/298">Pull Request & My Commits</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>HTTParty</h4>
            <p>A Ruby HTTP library that aims to make HTTP fun again. I fixed an issue that was changing HEAD requests into GET requests when following redirects.</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty/pull/430">Pull Request & My Commits</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Ember Data Factory Guy</h4>
            <p>A tool to create factories for testing in Ember.js. I fixed a few typos in the README that would cause incorrect configuration.</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/danielspaniel/ember-data-factory-guy/pull/258">Pull Request & My Commits</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Calagator</h4>
            <p>A calendar aggregator site for tech events throughout the Portland region. One of my Pull Requests aimed to solve a bug that disallowed editing events added via import. My other contributions mostly had a focus on improving the user experience, including 1) dynamically inserting easily identifiable icons based on the user-given tags; 2) friendlier error pages for 404 and 500; 3) fixing machine tags to point to the correct external sites; and 4) modifying routes for filtering events by tag to make the URL more user friendly.</p>

          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>rubocop</h4>
            <p>Configurable linting tool for ruby. I fixed a typo in the documentation.</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/pull/4561">Pull Request & My Commits</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Paranoia</h4>
            <p>A tool to allow "soft-deletions" of database models. I added some clarifying language to the README about when and how certain callbacks were executed.</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/rubysherpas/paranoia/pull/367">Pull Request & My Commits</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Active Admin Sortable Tree</h4>
            <p>An extension for the Active Admin tool to display index pages as sortable trees. I added some version compatibility notes to the README.</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/zorab47/active_admin-sortable_tree/pull/59">Pull Request & My Commits</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Temping</h4>
            <p>A tool to create temporary table-backed models for tests. I added some clarifying language to the README after getting stuck on a simple hurdle when trying to get it working.</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/jpignata/temping/pull/43">Pull Request & My Commits</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Plaid-Ruby</h4>
            <p>A Ruby gem for interacting with the Plaid banking API. I updated the documentation based on some troubles I had in connecting to the API using the gem.</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/plaid/plaid-ruby/commits?author=supremebeing7">My Commits</a>
            <a href="https://github.com/plaid/plaid-ruby">View Source</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Cheddar Robot</h4>
            <p>A web app I created that would allow automating certain bank related tasks, such as watching account balances and transactions and triggering transfers based on the transaction description. The initial goal was an If This Then That style of banking for consultants and independent contractors to automatically transfer portions of paychecks into savings or retirement accounts.</p>
            <p>This app was a proof-of-concept, is no longer being developed and is not currently functioning.</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/supremebeing7/cheddar_robot/">View Source</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Githubrepo</h4>
            <p>A simple Ruby gem that will allow one to create a repository in Github from the command line. I contributed the option to add a description, make it auto-copy the repository link to the clipboard, and allow one to request the SSH link rather than the HTTP link.</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/elikem/githubrepo/commits?author=supremebeing7">My Commits</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Mailboxer</h4>
            <p>A Rails gem to send messages inside a web application. I fixed the mailer views generator which had become broken when someone had added namespacing on a newer release. I also updated the README with instructions for running the views generator and logged several bugs in attempting to make the gem compatible with Rails 4.1+.</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/mailboxer/mailboxer/pull/291">Pull Request & My Commits</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Sidekiq Snitch</h4>
            <p>A simple Rails engine to monitor your Sidekiq queue using Dead Man's Snitch. I made a change so that it would only try to run this if a Snitch URL was configured - before this change, the tool would continuously run and error.</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/spacebabies/sidekiq_snitch/commits?author=supremebeing7">My Commits</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Launchy</h4>
            <p>A Ruby helper for launching cross-platform applications in a fire and forget manner. I added clarifying information in the README about using it in conjunction with the Capybara testing tool.</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/copiousfreetime/launchy/commits?author=supremebeing7">My Commits</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Textacular</h4>
            <p>A Ruby gem that exposes full text search capabilities from PostgreSQL, and allows you to declare full text indexes. I added clarifying information to the README about the fuzzy search capability. This was my first open source contribution.</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/textacular/textacular/commits?author=supremebeing7">My Commits</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Gitlab</h4>
            <p>A Ruby wrapper and CLI for the GitLab REST API. I committed clarifying instructions to the README.</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/NARKOZ/gitlab/commits?author=supremebeing7">My Commits</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Toggl API Docs</h4>
            <p>Some simple typo fixes.</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/toggl/toggl_api_docs/pull/181">Pull Request & My Commits</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Masonry Rails</h4>
            <p>An adaptation of the jQuery Masonry plugin ready for use with Rails asset pipeline. I contributed fixes for typos and missing closing tags in examples on README.</p>
